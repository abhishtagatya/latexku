    ABSTRACT = {Image segmentation, which has become a research hotspot in the field of image processing and computer vision, refers to the process of dividing an image into meaningful and non-overlapping regions, and it is an essential step in natural scene understanding. Despite decades of effort and many achievements, there are still challenges in feature extraction and model design. In this paper, we review the advancement in image segmentation methods systematically. According to the segmentation principles and image data characteristics, three important stages of image segmentation are mainly reviewed, which are classic segmentation, collaborative segmentation, and semantic segmentation based on deep learning. We elaborate on the main algorithms and key techniques in each stage, compare, and summarize the advantages and defects of different segmentation models, and discuss their applicability. Finally, we analyze the main challenges and development trends of image segmentation techniques.},

    abstract = {The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},
